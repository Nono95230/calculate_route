  * Calculate Route can be used to create a Google map with the ability to calculate a route from one address to another. It is placed in a block (this block is usually present on the contact page). Developed with Google Maps API and Jquery API, it is strongly
    customizable: you can customize Google Map settings, marker settings, route form settings and overall appearance settings.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

  * Calculate Route 8.x-5.x requires Drupal 8 & the core field module enabled.

  * Calculate Route has no version on Drupal 7.

  * Calculate Route needs the jQuery Colorpicker module to work.

  * The jQuery Colorpicker module needs the jQuery Colorpicker library to work

  See the Drupal 8 instructions if required in the Drupal documentation for further information.
